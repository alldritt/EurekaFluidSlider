I found the [Ramotion Fluid Slider](https://github.com/Ramotion/fluid-slider) and thought it would be interesting to integrate it into a [Eureka](https://eurekacommunity.github.io) form.

This project demonstrates how to accomplish this using my [ViewRow](https://github.com/EurekaCommunity/ViewRow) class for Eureka.
